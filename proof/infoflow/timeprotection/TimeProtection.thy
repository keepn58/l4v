  KSHARED
  - some concrete set of addresses that spans various colours
  - kernel steps may access these addresses - therefore there are time flows through pch
  - we make the pch of all these addresses deterministic at domain-switch
  - we may say that kshared includes all of the collision sets within itself




  UWR u (CURRENTLY RUNNNING)
  - all of fch
  - pch (for addresses in colour(u))
    - user transitions: only above
    - kernel transitions: also addresses in kshared
  - tm 
  - all of regs
  - other_state (according to external UWR u)

  UWR u (NOT RUNNNING)
  - none of fch
  - pch (for addresses in colour(u))
    - user transitions: only above
    - kernel transitions: also addresses in kshared
  - none of tm
  - none of regs

  for some step (let's say the user step for example), for a step of the NOT CURRENTLY RUNNING
  domain d:
  - we have two programs derived from touched_addresses - may not be the same touched_addresses (? ? ?)
    - we may not have concrete touched_addresses-es - we may overapprox this to the whole currently running domain
  - these touched_addresses does NOT contain any addresses from d
  - initial states s and t hold uwr_notrunning
  - we execute both programs
  - new state s' and t' hold uwr_notrunning
  - this will rely on infoflow properties of external_uwr

  ...and for a step of the CURRENTLY RUNNING domain d:
  - we have two programs derived from the same touched_addresses
    - these have to be the same program (so we need to know that the choice depends on stuff in
      other_state in the external uwr)
  - that touched_addresses ONLY contains addresses in d
  - initial states s and t hold uwr_running
  - we execute the program on both states
  - new states s' and t' hold uwr_running
  - this will rely on infoflow properties of external_uwr
